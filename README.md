Fuzzy Text International 2
==========================

A watchface for [Pebble][] that displays the time as natural language - "quarter past three", "half past ten" - in your choice of language and visual style.

Originally based on [PebbleTextWatch][] by Mihai Dumitrache, with fuzzy time and Swedish support added by [Mattias Bäcklund][Mattias], and multi-language configuration by [Jesse Hallett][Jesse]. This fork extends that work with additional languages, user experience improvements, and a cleaner architecture for contributors.

--------------------------

To add a new language:

1. **Create `src/c/strings-XX.h`** - declare the arrays and suffix function:
   ```c
   #pragma once
   extern const char* const HOURS_XX[24];
   extern const char* const RELS_XX[12];
   const char* date_suffix_XX(int date);
   ```

2. **Create `src/c/strings-XX.c`** - define 24 hour names, 12 relative-time phrases, and a suffix function (return `""` if your language doesn't use ordinal suffixes):
   ```c
   #include "strings-XX.h"
   const char* const HOURS_XX[] = { /* 12 AM + 12 PM hour names */ };
   const char* const RELS_XX[] = {
     "*$1 ...",   /* on the hour   */
     /* 11 more five-minute intervals */
   };
   const char* date_suffix_XX(int date) { return ""; }
   ```
   In the `RELS_XX` phrases, `$1` is replaced with the current hour and `$2` with the next. A `*` prefix makes that word bold.

3. **Register the language in `src/c/num2words.h`** - add one row to `ALL_LANGUAGES` with a unique integer value:
   ```c
   X(XX, 0xN)
   ```

4. **Add the include in `src/c/num2words.c`**:
   ```c
   #include "strings-XX.h"
   ```

5. **Wire up the JS side** - add the language to `src/pkjs/pebble-js-app.js`:
   ```javascript
   xx: N
   ```
   And add an `<option>` to the select in `src/pkjs/config-html.js`.
